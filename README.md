# Stimulating Banking System in Python 3

This project is a stimulation of a simple banking system in Python. A user can create account by entering his name and the amount he wants to deposit. The system generates a 5 digit random account 
number.

The user can perform deposit, withdraw and check balance functions once he has an account in the 
bank and is validated. 

## Concepts Implemented 
1. Abstract Base Class
2. Overriding
3. Single Level Inheritance
4. Abstraction
5. Encapsulation
6. Dictionary in Python

### Overriding

Modifying the inherited behaviour of methods of a base class in a derived class is called overriding.
 

           
### Single Level Inheritance

Inheriting the attributes and methods of a base class into a
derived class is called Inheritance.


### Abstract Base Class (ABC)

A base class which contains abstract methods that are to
be overridden in its derived class is called an abstract base
class. They belong to the abc module.
